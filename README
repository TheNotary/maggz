I wrote this a long, long time ago when I was in highschool I guess.  Since then VB6 has been shut down due to TOO_MUCH_AWESOME_OVERFLOW problems with it's precompiler.  


NOTE:  Sometimes it makes a really loud crackle instead of playing one of the wav files normally...  I never figured out why it did that.
